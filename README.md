<h1> <p align="center"> <b> Lab 3: Web Map Application</b> </p>
</br>
<h5> <p align="left"> The purpose of lab 3 is to create an <a href="https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog458/tree/master/labs/lab03" target="_blank">interactive web map</a> with a thematic style that illustrates a chosen statistic or topic. This choropleth map in particular, displays the number of airports within each state, according to pre-defined data intervals. Additionally, symbols are included to represent airports themselves. The standard basemap is from openstreetmap. Paramters for the mymap variable, allow it to center the map to the United States. </p>

<h5> <p> For the data source, two geoJSON files were used - airports and usstates. The former was converted from a shapefile, with its original owner being <a href = "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-airports-of-the-united-states-201207-shapefile" target = "_blank"> Data.gov</a>. The latter contains state boundaries and was acquired from <a href = "https://bost.ocks.org/mike/" target = "_blank"> Mike Bostock</a>. Credit and acknowledge goes towards Professor Bo Zhao and anyone who assisted in designing the lab.</p>
